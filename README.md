# About the project

This is a reactjs app created using the create react app. The app displays a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner. I've also extended it a bit to order the list of dogs as well.

The concerns are separated by having separate components for each of the task.

Tests are created using the default React Testing Library under each of the component/service folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` from the application root folder

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
